**Machine-learning-Stroke**

This repository contains various machine learning models trained on a stroke dataset using caret in R. The repository contain various screening tool developed by shny to assess individuals who are at risk of developing stroke 

**Study Objectives**

This study aimed to develop a high-performing machine learning model trained on a stroke dataset and deploy it within an interactive Shiny web application. The integrated system is designed for practical use in real-world healthcare settings to facilitate stroke risk assessment, support early diagnosis, and promote personalized treatment strategies.

**Data importation and inspection**

The dataset was imported into R from a CSV file for analysis. Preliminary data exploration was conducted to understand the overall structure of the dataset, including the types and number of variables. A thorough assessment was carried out to identify and address any missing values or duplicate entries, which could potentially bias the results. Additionally, the distribution of the primary study outcome variable was examined using appropriate summary statistics.
