## 🚀 Project Summary

> 🧑‍⚕️ **Goal**: Predict the likelihood of stroke occurrence using individual health and demographic data.

This project:
- Implements multiple **ML models in R** with the `caret` and `Boruta` packages
- Uses **feature selection**, **cross-validation**, and **resampling**
- Deploys an **interactive Shiny app** to assess individual stroke risk

## 📊 Data Overview

- **Rows**: 5,110  
- **Features**: 12 (demographic + health metrics)  
- **Target**: `stroke` (binary: Yes/No)

EDA ensured:
- Type integrity, missing value cleanup
- Removal of outliers (`BMI`)
- Removal of irrelevant columns (`id`)
- Detection of class imbalance (`stroke: 4700 No / 209 Yes`)

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

✔️ Label-encoded categorical variables  
✔️ Converted BMI to numeric and removed non-numeric entries  
✔️ Dropped `id`, `gender`, and `Residence_type` as non-informative  
✔️ Applied **downsampling** to balance the target classes

---

## 🔍 Feature Selection

Used the **Boruta algorithm** (based on Random Forest) to identify important predictors.

🎯 **Selected Features**:
```
age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married,
work_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status
```

❌ `gender` and `Residence_type` were excluded.

## 🧪 Model Training & Evaluation

### 🛠️ Training Control Strategy

```r
fitcontrol = trainControl(
  method = "repeatedcv",
  number = 10,
  repeats = 3,
  classProbs = TRUE,
  summaryFunction = twoClassSummary
)
```

- 10-fold cross-validation repeated 3 times
- Evaluation metrics: **AUC**, **Sensitivity**, **Specificity**
- Resampling reduces overfitting and improves reliability

## 🌐 Shiny App

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/placeholder/stroke-app-ui.png" alt="Shiny App Screenshot" width="80%" />
</p>

The app allows users to:
- Enter age, glucose, work type, BMI, smoking status, etc.
- Receive instant stroke risk predictions
- View prediction confidence (probability output)

```r
shiny::runApp("shiny_app/")
```
