**Machine-learning-Stroke**

This repository contains various machine learning models trained on a stroke dataset using caret in R. The repository contain various screening tool developed by shny to assess individuals who are at risk of developing stroke 

**Study Objectives**

This study aimed to develop a high-performing machine learning model trained on a stroke dataset and deploy it within an interactive Shiny web application. The integrated system is designed for practical use in real-world healthcare settings to facilitate stroke risk assessment, support early diagnosis, and promote personalized treatment strategies.
